How to install and run our system:

1. Download and unzip files
2. Open a Terminal window at the root of the directory (called "final_project" by default)
3. Run the following command (no quotes): "opam install bogue"
4. Once Bogue has finished installing, build the project using dune as follows (no quotes): "dune build"
5. Then, run the program by running the following command (no quotes): "dune exec ./_build/default/bin/main.exe"

Done! The main game window should now open. Clicking any of the four buttons will open another window for each game. We plan to run the games in their own windows then close them automatically once the game concludes. For now, please close the game windows as you would close any other window. To close the program altogether, close the main menu window (and any game windows that are currently open).

Please let us know if you have any questions!
